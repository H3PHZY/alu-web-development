CSS Advanced

In this project, we will style the webpage created in the previous project (HTML Advanced) using CSS. CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to enhance the visual appearance of HTML code. It allows you to add design elements like fonts, colors, text sizes, backgrounds, padding, float, and more to improve the overall look of a webpage. We'll apply these styles to give our project a polished appearance.

Hereâ€™s a link to how the final project will look: [View Final Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oUJCZGWPr19ELC-UvyH3vxcXP4xesHXO/view?usp=sharing).
